    <div class="container"><p>Recipe Analysis UI Demo<br><br><br>This is a rough demo of how the new recipe analysis UI could work. It combines the advantages of both free-text and table in one unified, coherent UI. Furthermore, it allows saving the table results thereby largely reducing the need for recalculating free-text time and time again after each keystroke, thereby enabling significant app performance boosts. It will also enable resolving the issue of diverging language translations and pave the way for new features like recipe variations and substitutions. Upon clicking on commit the user has the opportunity to modify each cell and the free-text is saved into the database along with the user adjustments so that the AI could learn in the future how to better parse the free-text.<br><br>  In this demo the user can type or copy/paste one ingredient line or multiple lines at once, the text is live parsed into a table and upon clicking commit the user can then modify each cell, or drag and drop entire rows to rearrange the order. After clicking commit the user can type more free-text that will automatically be appended to the table.<br><br>  Please bear in mind that the end product would be a lot more refined both visually as well as regarding features, as this demo was coded by someone that is not a frontend coder. E.g. drag and drop would also be enabled between cells, multiple rows could also be drag an dropped, and the entire table or multiple rows could be selected to copy/paste the content in another recipe segment or in an entirely different recipe. Also the buttons for deleting, committing and adding rows would be a lot more subtle, e.g. like a plus symbol appearing when hovering the mouse cursor between two rows.</p><br><br>
